## **Storytelling with Insights**

### 1. **Internet Service Analysis**

- **Fiber Optic dominates** with 62.11% of total monthly charges, followed by **DSL** at 30.71%. Despite its higher cost, Fiber Optic's popularity suggests a strong demand for high-speed internet.
- Customers with **no internet service** account for only 7.05% of charges, highlighting the company's core internet-driven revenue model.

**Opportunity:** Address churn in Fiber Optic customers, as they represent the highest revenue potential but also pose the greatest churn risk.

### 2. **Churn Rate by Tenure and Internet Service**

- Churn is significantly higher for customers with **shorter tenures**, particularly those using **Fiber Optic** services.
- A clear trend emerges: **longer-tenured customers** exhibit lower churn rates, underscoring the value of loyalty-building initiatives.

**Opportunity:** Introduce retention incentives such as discounts or perks for newer customers to extend their tenure.

### 3. **Demographics: Gender and Senior Citizens**

- **Multiple Lines Analysis:** The majority of customers do not use multiple lines. Those who do are evenly distributed across genders, indicating a balanced usage pattern.
- **Senior Citizens and Device Protection:**
  - 54.64% of senior citizens have **device protection**, while 40.81% do not.
  - This gap presents an opportunity to promote device protection plans tailored to the senior demographic, enhancing security and trust.

**Opportunity:** Upsell device protection plans to senior citizens to improve satisfaction and minimize churn.

### 4. **Payment Methods and Contracts**

- **Electronic Check users** account for the highest share of monthly charges (39.54%), but this payment method is often associated with higher churn due to ease of cancellation.
- **Automatic payments** via Credit Card or Bank Transfer contribute to stable revenues and likely correlate with better retention rates.
- Customers on **month-to-month contracts** generate the highest charges but show a higher propensity to churn due to lack of commitment.

**Opportunity:**
- Encourage electronic check users to switch to automatic payment methods by offering incentives.
- Convert month-to-month customers to long-term contracts with loyalty rewards or bundled offers.

### 5. **Regional Trends and Monthly Charges**

- Customers on **month-to-month contracts** are the biggest contributors to monthly charges but are more volatile in terms of churn.
- **Two-year contracts**, while generating lower revenue, exhibit greater stability, highlighting the need for loyalty programs to lock in long-term commitments.

**Opportunity:** Promote long-term contracts with exclusive benefits to balance revenue generation and stability.
